        <p>
          ZEN cards have a very neat feature that will help you <br />
          whenever your electronic devices start failing after the <br />
          standard warranty ends,which is pretty common.
        </p>

        <p>
        When you buy any electronics with your ZEN shopping <br />
        MastercardÂ®, their warranty gets extended by one <br />
         year. How does it work? It simply does. Automatically.
