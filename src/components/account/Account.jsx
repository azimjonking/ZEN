          ZEN Mastercard® was made for spending money. ZEN <br /> account is here to
          store and manage it peacefully, from the <br /> inside of your pocket.
          <br />
          <br />
          You can use it just like a regular account, as it has its own <br /> IBAN and
          works just the way any bank account would — <br /> but better. Store up to 30
          currencies and transfer them <br /> easily in many ways.
